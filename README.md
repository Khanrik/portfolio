# Henrik Huynh Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built with Javascript using React and Vite, styled using Tailwind CSS, and deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Features

- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Dark and light theme toggle
- Contact form powered by EmailJS
- Downloadable CV

## Use of Resources

I made this website to learn the React framework, as well as having a nice project to add to my portfolio. Since it is my first real Javascript project I have had a lot of aid through AI tools, documentation, and others' example projects. Most notably is [this tutorial by PedroTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGdPMf-SgBA). Other resources I used was these tutorials from [compiletab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63mEm3AMSY) and [Gark Codes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR1UayA1TYM).

Feel free to use anything I have made, but I won't assure anything other than it works on my website :)
